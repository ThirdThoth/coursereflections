Reflections

Initializing a repository creates a preliminary .git folder,
this indicates that this location is now a repository.
This initialization does not create a first commit: there are no commits yet.
This initialization only requires the command git init to execute.
If you don't initiate, then nothing is ever told to make a repository!
The stating area is a way to move exactly what you want into your repository.
It's useful, as it allows for a commit to be more properly prepared before submission.
